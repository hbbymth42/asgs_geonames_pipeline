# ASGS Geonames Data Pipeline
A Data Pipeline to create Shapefiles from the [ABS's Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) (Currently Edition 3)](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/latest-release) and the GeoNames [Postal Code](https://download.geonames.org/export/zip/) & [Placenames](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/) Datasets.

This is currently intended to assist with some personal projects, but figured this would also be useful for anyone wanting to work with Australian Geographical Data!

Broadly speaking, GeoNames provides points for places (and postal codes) around the world and the ASGS provides useful (specifically, Australian) areas for analysis (e.g. State & Local Government Areas, Statistical Areas, etc.).

For more information, see the [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) and [ASGS](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026) Documentation :)
